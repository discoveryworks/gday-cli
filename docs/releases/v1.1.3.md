# gday-cli v1.1.3 - Pomodoro Schedule Filtering

Filter conflicting pomodoro entries from schedule to reduce visual clutter and improve focus.

## What's New

**Smart Pomodoro Filtering**: 🍅 pomodoro rows now only appear during uncommitted time blocks, automatically skipping time slots that already have scheduled appointments.

## Before vs After

**Before (cluttered)**:
```
| 12:00pm  | 🍜 Lunch                          |
| 12:00pm  | 🍅                                |  ← Redundant
| 1:00pm   | 👑 Priority work                  |
| 1:00pm   | 🍅                                |  ← Redundant
```

**After (clean)**:
```
| 12:00pm  | 🍜 Lunch                          |
| 1:00pm   | 👑 Priority work                  |  
| 2:00pm   | 🍅                                |  ← Only free time
```

## Benefits

- **Cleaner schedules**: No duplicate entries cluttering your daily view
- **Better focus**: Pomodoro blocks only show true available time for todos
- **Maintained chronology**: All entries remain in proper time order

## Technical Details

- Pomodoro entries (🍅) are processed separately from calendar appointments
- Time slots occupied by real appointments exclude conflicting pomodoros
- Final schedule maintains chronological order across all entry types
