# gday-cli v1.1.3 - Pomodoro Schedule Filtering

Remove redundant pomodoro entries from schedule to reduce visual clutter and improve focus.

## What's New

**Smart Pomodoro Filtering**: 🍅 pomodoro rows now only appear during uncommitted time blocks, automatically skipping time slots that already have scheduled appointments.

## Why?

Pomodoros are added in via a pretty janky hack: a [calendar that's just all "🍅" entries.](pomodoro_calendar). The downside was a bunch of extra noise; this patch fixes that.

## Before vs After

**Before (cluttered)**:
```
| 12:30pm  | 🍜 Lunch                          |
| 12:30pm  | 🍅                                |  ← Redundant
| 1:00pm   | 👑 Priority work                  |
| 1:00pm   | 🍅                                |  ← Redundant
| 1:30pm   | 🍅                                |  ← Redundant
```

**After (clean)**:
```
| 12:30pm  | 🍜 Lunch                          |
| 1:00pm   | 👑 Priority work                  |
| 1:30pm   | 🍅                                |  ← Only free time
```
