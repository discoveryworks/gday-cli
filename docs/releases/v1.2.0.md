# gday-cli v1.2.0 - Appointment Grouping & Clean Output

Improve schedule readability with appointment grouping and cleaner markdown formatting.

## What's New

### 🎯 **Smart Appointment Grouping (New Default)**
Schedule entries now group appointment blocks together instead of strict chronological interleaving, making it much easier to read and understand your day.

**Before (interleaved)**:
```
| 7:00am  | 🚜 K construction sync           |
| 7:00am  | 🌞 Wake kiddos                   |
| 7:30am  | 🚜🚜 K construction sync          |
| 7:30am  | 🌞🌞 Wake kiddos                  |
```

**After (grouped)**:
```
| 7:00am  | 🚜 K construction sync           |
| 7:30am  | 🚜🚜 K construction sync          |
| 8:00am  | 🚜🚜🚜 K construction sync        |
| 7:00am  | 🌞 Wake kiddos                   |
| 7:30am  | 🌞🌞 Wake kiddos                  |
```

### 🎛️ **Sorting Control Flags**
Choose your preferred schedule layout:
- `--sort-alpha` - Group appointments together (default)
- `--sort-interleaved` - Strict chronological order

### 🧹 **Cleaner Markdown Output**
Fixed trailing whitespace in "Later Today..." section headers for cleaner markdown files.

## Usage Examples

```bash
gday                          # Default appointment grouping
gday --sort-alpha friday      # Friday with appointment grouping  
gday --sort-interleaved       # Old chronological behavior
gday --sort-interleaved later # Later today with time sorting
```

## Benefits

- **Better Readability**: See each appointment as a cohesive time block
- **Flexible Options**: Choose your preferred sorting style
- **Cleaner Files**: No more trailing whitespace in markdown output
- **Backward Compatible**: `--sort-interleaved` preserves old behavior
