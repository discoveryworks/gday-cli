# gday-cli v1.1.1 - Emoji Padding & Table Alignment

Minor release introducing emoji padding to visually indicate meeting duration, plus table formatting improvements.

## What's New in v1.1.0

- **🎯 Emoji Duration Padding**: Visual meeting length indication using repeated emojis
  - 1 emoji = 30 minutes, 2 emojis = 1 hour, 4 emojis = 2 hours, etc.
  - Automatically detects first emoji in appointment titles and repeats it
  - Falls back to time-appropriate clock emoji if no leading emoji found

## What's Fixed in v1.1.1

- **Table Alignment**: Fixed markdown table right-hand pipe alignment when using emoji padding
- **Visual Width Calculation**: Added emoji-aware padding that accounts for emoji display width in terminals
- **Clean Formatting**: All calendar entries now maintain consistent column widths for proper markdown rendering

## Emoji Padding Examples

**2-hour construction meeting:**
```
| 8:00am | 🚜 K construction sync        |
| 8:30am | 🚜🚜 K construction sync       |
| 9:00am | 🚜🚜🚜 K construction sync      |

```

**Morning routine with multiple emojis:**
```
| 7:00am | 🍳👖🪥🚌 Wake kiddos           |
| 7:30am | 🍳🍳👖🪥🚌 Wake kiddos          |
| 8:00am | 🍳🍳🍳👖🪥🚌 Wake kiddos         |
| 8:30am | 🍳🍳🍳🍳👖🪥🚌 Wake kiddos        |
```

**Meeting without emoji (adds clock):**
```
| 1:00pm | 🕐 Emily - am                 |
| 1:30pm | 🕜🕜 Emily - am                |
| 2:00pm | 🕑🕑🕑 Emily - am               |
```

## Technical Details

Meeting duration is now immediately visible at a glance! The feature detects the first emoji in each appointment title and repeats it for each 30-minute time block. For appointments without leading emojis, appropriate clock emojis are added based on the start time.
