# gday-cli v1.3.0 - Appointment Grouping & Flexible Sorting

Comprehensive schedule formatting improvements with appointment grouping and flexible sorting controls.

## What's New

### 🎯 **Smart Appointment Grouping (New Default)**
Schedule entries now group appointment blocks together instead of strict chronological interleaving, dramatically improving readability.

**Before (interleaved)**:
```
| 7:00am  | 🚜 K construction sync           |
| 7:00am  | 🌞 Wake kiddos                   |
| 7:30am  | 🚜🚜 K construction sync          |
| 7:30am  | 🌞🌞 Wake kiddos                  |
```

**After (grouped)**:
```
| 7:00am  | 🚜 K construction sync           |
| 7:30am  | 🚜🚜 K construction sync          |
| 8:00am  | 🚜🚜🚜 K construction sync        |
| 7:00am  | 🌞 Wake kiddos                   |
| 7:30am  | 🌞🌞 Wake kiddos                  |
```

### 🎛️ **Flexible Sorting Controls**
New CLI flags give you complete control over schedule layout:
- `--sort-alpha` - Group appointments together (new default)
- `--sort-interleaved` - Strict chronological order (old behavior)

### 📋 **Enhanced Help Documentation**
Updated help text includes sorting options and practical examples for all new features.

### 🍒 **Cherry Tomato Time Indicators**
Off-hour appointments (not :00 or :30) now get clock emojis with cherry tomato indicators:
- `10:15am` → 🕙🍒 (rounds down to 10:00 + cherry indicator)
- `11:45am` → 🕦🍒 (rounds down to 11:30 + cherry indicator) 
- `12:30pm` → 🕧 (exact time match, no cherry needed)

Cherry tomatoes represent "smaller than a 25-minute 🍅 pomodoro" time blocks.

### 🧹 **Clean Markdown Output**
Fixed trailing whitespace in "Later Today..." section headers for cleaner markdown files.

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Default appointment grouping (recommended)
gday                          

# Specific sorting modes
gday --sort-alpha friday      # Friday with appointment grouping  
gday --sort-interleaved       # Old chronological behavior
gday --sort-interleaved later # Later today with time sorting

# Works with all date options
gday --sort-alpha yesterday
gday --sort-interleaved "June 5, 1986"
```

## Benefits

- **Dramatically Better Readability**: See each appointment as a cohesive time block
- **Flexible Control**: Choose your preferred sorting style via CLI flags
- **Backward Compatible**: `--sort-interleaved` preserves v1.2.0 behavior
- **Cleaner Files**: No trailing whitespace in markdown output
- **Enhanced UX**: Comprehensive help documentation with practical examples

## Breaking Changes

**None** - The new appointment grouping is the default, but all existing functionality is preserved. Users preferring the old chronological interleaving can use `--sort-interleaved`.
