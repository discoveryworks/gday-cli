# Release Process

This document outlines the complete release process for gday-cli, including Homebrew formula updates.

## Version Bumping Strategy

Follow semantic versioning (semver):
- **Major (x.0.0)**: Breaking changes, API changes  
- **Minor (1.x.0)**: New features, significant enhancements
- **Patch (1.6.x)**: Bug fixes, small improvements

## Release Steps

### 1. Prepare the Release

```bash
# Ensure all tests pass
npm test

# Update version in both files
# - lib/version.sh: GDAY_VERSION="x.y.z"  
# - package.json: "version": "x.y.z"

# Create release notes
# - docs/releases/vx.y.z.md following existing format
```

### 2. Commit Version Changes

```bash
git add lib/version.sh package.json docs/releases/vx.y.z.md
git commit -m "feat: Release vx.y.z with [brief summary]

# - New SHA256: sha256 "[new_hash]"
# - Updated test version assertion: assert_match "VERSION: x.y.z"

# Commit and push

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Homebrew formula update fails:**
- Ensure SHA256 is correct (run `shasum -a 256` on downloaded archive)
- Check that GitHub release exists and is public
- Verify tap repository permissions

**Version doesn't update:**
- Check both `lib/version.sh` and `package.json` are updated
- Ensure all changes are committed before tagging
- Clear any local caches: `brew cleanup`

**Tests fail after version bump:**
- Update any version assertions in test files
- Update `test-installation.sh` expected version
- Verify no hardcoded version strings elsewhere

## Important Notes

- **Always update Homebrew formula** - This is not optional, users depend on it
- Homebrew is the primary distribution method for macOS users
- Formula updates should happen immediately after GitHub release
- Test the Homebrew installation before considering release complete
