# Calendar Configuration
calendars:
  - "Work Calendar"
  - "Personal"  
  - "Appointments"

# Prompt Groups with Rotation
prompts:
  - name: "Daily Reflection"
    frequency: daily
    content:
      - "## What's top of mind today?"
      - "## What did you accomplish yesterday?"
  
  - name: "Weekly Planning" 
    frequency: rotating(2)  # Show 2 items, rotate through all
    content:
      - "## What are your 3 priorities this week?"
      - "## What meetings need preparation?"
      - "## What can you delegate or eliminate?"

# Appointments to exclude from "Later Today" section
filtered_appointments:
  - "üçÖ Pomodoro Break"
  - "üçú Lunch"
  - "Personal Time"
```

## Features

- **Smart Calendar Integration**: Fetches events from multiple Google Calendars
- **Configurable Prompts**: YAML-based prompt system with daily/rotating/random frequencies
- **Time Block Formatting**: Automatic 30-minute time blocks with emoji indicators
- **Filtered Views**: Exclude routine appointments from planning sections
- **Multi-day Support**: View any recent day's schedule
- **CLI-Native**: Designed for terminal-based workflows

## Requirements

- macOS (tested on macOS 14+)
- `gcalcli` (Google Calendar CLI)
- `zsh` or `bash` shell
- Google Calendar API access

## Troubleshooting

**"No Events" showing:**
- Run `gday auth` to re-authenticate
- Check calendar names in config match Google Calendar exactly
- Verify `gcalcli agenda today today` works independently

**Permission errors:**
- Ensure `~/.config/gday/config.yml` is readable
- Check Google Calendar sharing settings

**Missing dependencies:**
- Install gcalcli: `pip install gcalcli`
- On first run: `gcalcli init` to set up OAuth
