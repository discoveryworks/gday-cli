## Design and Accessibility
- Design mobile-first, then scale up to larger screens
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes appropriately
- Make interactive elements at least 44x44px for easy tapping
- Implement touch gestures and native-like features when appropriate
- Maintain sufficient color contrast and keyboard navigation
- Strive to build design *systems*, enshrined in semantic Design Tokens

## Styling
- Favor Tailwind CSS for styling wherever possible
- THE DOM SHOULD ALWAYS BE SEMANTIC! Use meaningful class and id names
- Use the @apply directive to abstract utility classes to semantic classes
- Only apply utility classes directly to DOM elements when exceptional
- Leverage DaisyUI components for rapid development
- Define and use design tokens in tailwind.config.js
- Ensure responsive design using Tailwind's breakpoint prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:)
- Create consistent design systems with tokens for colors, typography, spacing

## Tables
- number comparison tables should always use monospace fonts and right alignment in columns which contain numbers being used for comparison
